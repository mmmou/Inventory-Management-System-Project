# Inventory-Management-System-Project
The project aims at providing an efficient interface to a company for managing their product inventory based on each item sold. The basic idea involved here is that each item is linked to its atomic product which is stored in a database. At the end of each day, the system analyses the total sale of stocks items and proportionately deducts appropriate amount from the resource database. Then it compares the current available resources with the threshold level of each product. If it finds that certain product are below the threshold, it will generate a purchase order for those items and send it to the manager (admin) for approval.
